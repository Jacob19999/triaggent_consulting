# Portfolio projects

`gradient-descent/` is the production build of the interactive course at
[Jacob19999/gradient-descent](https://github.com/Jacob19999/gradient-descent),
currently built from commit `dd2dd02`. It is served at
`/portfolio/gradient-descent/` and linked from the homepage portfolio section.

To refresh it, build the course with `npm run build`, then replace the contents
of `portfolio/gradient-descent/` with the contents of the course's `dist/`
directory. Preserve the directory structure: its JavaScript, styles, fonts,
and model weights load from `assets/` relative to `index.html`.

`mission-control/` is a read-only replay of the EDF mission-control console from
[Jacob19999/tvc-retro-propulsion](https://github.com/Jacob19999/tvc-retro-propulsion)
(`simulation/isaac/mission_control`). It is a static page served at
`/portfolio/mission-control/`: the real UI replays 13 recorded NVIDIA Isaac Sim
flights (convex SOCP powered-descent guidance on an electric ducted-fan
vehicle, including two failures) from gzipped JSON in `api/`. Nothing runs
server-side; launching new missions is disabled by `demo-shim.js`. To refresh
it, run `python -m mission_control.export_static_demo <this repo>/portfolio/mission-control`
from `simulation/isaac` in the source repo, then replace this directory. It must
stay together: every URL is relative to `index.html`.

`beyond-wrvus/` is a password-protected, explorable copy of the Beyond wRVUs value platform at
`/portfolio/beyond-wrvus/`. `index.html` holds only the AES-256-GCM-encrypted page and a password
form, which decrypts it in the browser (key from PBKDF2-SHA256). Nothing runs server-side, and the
current files hold only ciphertext. Commits before the password was added still contain the
plaintext page. It runs on public data (CMS Medicare 2024, NCI
State Cancer Profiles, USDA, Census, ClinicalTrials.gov) with d3 and topojson vendored under
`vendor/`. The password-protected `sgo/` app carries the full version, including the licensed
MarketView layer; this copy omits that module and any internal paths. To refresh it, run
`python3 build_platform.py --public` and then `node encrypt_public_copy.mjs` in the BData repo's
`women opportunity/platform/` folder. The second command asks for the page password and writes the
encrypted `index.html` and `vendor/` here. Never copy the plaintext build into this directory. Keep
`index.html` and `vendor/` together.

`asrs-precedent-graph/` is the Aviation Precedent Explorer at
`/portfolio/asrs-precedent-graph/`. It searches NASA ASRS reports and NTSB investigations in
one browser interface, with source filters, AI narrative summaries, source abstracts and
source-qualified deep links. Precomputed Qwen3-Embedding-8B narrative similarities surface
cross-source analogues; the comparison view shows both summaries and shared coded factors.
Similar reports are not automatically treated as the same incident.

The unified corpus and data exporter live in
[Jacob19999/cis634](https://github.com/Jacob19999/cis634). Use
`export_precedent_graph_v2.py --without-graph` before separate LLM graph extraction is ready.
Reports and narratives are sharded; all files must come from the same export. See
[the explorer README](asrs-precedent-graph/README.md) for preview commands, regeneration,
search behaviour and provenance rules. The earlier graph-explorer pipeline overwrites
`index.html`; do not run it over this page.

The hosted FoodBridge app is the Next.js project at `apps/foodbridge/` (manager workspace,
shelf portal, and findings). It ships county and tract aggregates only: no site identifiers,
census blocks, or licensed Map the Meal Gap values. Rebuild the bundle in the Maverick
Intelligence repository with `uv run python -m mi.foodbridge_bundle`, copy `data/research.json`
and `public/data/` into `apps/foodbridge/`, and redeploy that Vercel project.
`portfolio/foodbridge/` redirects to the hosted app at https://foodbridge-jet.vercel.app/.
