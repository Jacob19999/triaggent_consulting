# Triaggent Consulting website

This repository contains the public [Triaggent Consulting website](https://triaggent.com/), its PHP contact form, and the SGO Market Atlas project.

## What's here

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Public homepage. It is a bundled export; the original authoring source is not in this repository. |
| `contact.php`, `contact-config.php` | Contact form endpoint and shared configuration. Start from `contact-config.local.php.example` for local settings. |
| `portfolio/gradient-descent/` | Static build of the [Gradient Descent interactive course](https://github.com/Jacob19999/gradient-descent), served at `/portfolio/gradient-descent/`. |
| `portfolio/mission-control/` | Static, read-only replay of the [EDF mission-control console](https://github.com/Jacob19999/tvc-retro-propulsion) with recorded Isaac Sim landing and hover flights, served at `/portfolio/mission-control/`. See [portfolio/README.md](portfolio/README.md). |
| `portfolio/beyond-wrvus/` | Password-protected static copy of the Beyond wRVUs value platform (gynecologic oncology program value, public data), served at `/portfolio/beyond-wrvus/`. The page is stored encrypted and decrypts in the browser. See [portfolio/README.md](portfolio/README.md). The licensed MarketView atlas module is not included. |
| `portfolio/asrs-precedent-graph/` | Aviation Precedent Explorer at `/portfolio/asrs-precedent-graph/`: unified ASRS + NTSB summary search, source filters, shared coded factors and cross-source narrative comparisons. See [the explorer README](portfolio/asrs-precedent-graph/README.md). |
| `asrs-graph/` | Knowledge graph that a local LLM (Qwen3-8B) extracted from all 47,723 ASRS report narratives (events, causes, equipment, flight phases and cause/effect triples), with the extraction script. The Precedent Graph page is built from it. See [asrs-graph/README.md](asrs-graph/README.md). |
| `apps/foodbridge/` | Next.js FoodBridge app (manager workspace, shelf portal, findings). Deployed as its own Vercel project with root directory `apps/foodbridge`. County and tract aggregates only. |
| `sgo/` | Password-protected PHP version of the SGO Market Atlas. `sgo/platform.php` is the Beyond wRVUs value platform (public-data dashboards, scenario model, and a local-file atlas); it shares the atlas login and reads its data from encrypted `sgo/data/platform_*.json.enc`. |
| `sgo-next/` | Separate Next.js version of the atlas; see its [README](sgo-next/README.md). |

The homepage portfolio also links to the separate [Optimist Club of Minnesota Valley website](https://optimistmv.com/) and campaign websites for [Toby Leonard](https://www.mankatomayor.com/), [Jackie Henry](https://www.henry4senate.com/), and [Joel Hollerich](https://www.joelhollerich.com/).

## Previewing the public pages

From the repository root, run `python3 -m http.server 8000` and open `http://localhost:8000/`. This previews the homepage and the static Gradient Descent course. The contact form and SGO PHP app require a PHP-capable server.

## Updating the course

Build the [course source repository](https://github.com/Jacob19999/gradient-descent) with `npm ci` and `npm run build`. Copy the contents of its `dist/` directory into `portfolio/gradient-descent/`, keeping `index.html` and the `assets/` directory together. See [portfolio/README.md](portfolio/README.md) for the source revision used for the current build.

## Publishing

This repository does not contain a GitHub Actions or GitHub Pages deployment setup. Merge changes here, then publish the repository's public site files to the web root configured for `triaggent.com` using the hosting account's deployment method. Keep the full `portfolio/gradient-descent/` directory together so its relative asset links resolve.

Keep local contact settings and any plaintext SGO datasets out of the public repository. The relevant paths are gitignored; the SGO deployment details are in [sgo-next/README.md](sgo-next/README.md).
